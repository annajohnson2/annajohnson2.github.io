     <div>    <h1> Horses </h1>
<p> Horses are a four legged mammal, their eyes are on the side of their head so they cant see straight ahead very well. They have a tail which is on the end of their bum and a mane which is hair on the top on their neck. They get ridden by humans in differnt styles such as Show jumping, dressage, show hunter, weston barrel races, treking, hunting and games. although I listed quite a few there are heaps more riding styles.  </p>
<p> Horses come in all colours and sizes, ranging from 20hh (one hand is 10cm, hh=hands high to 14 inches (35.5cm). Theres over 350 horse breeds across the entire world! They are very sweet animals, I like horses. </p>
