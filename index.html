<h1> Horses </h1>
Horses are a four legged mammal, their eyes are on the side of their head so they cant see straight ahead very well. They have a tail which is on the end of their bum and a mane which is hair on the top on their neck.
Horses come in all colours and sizes, ranging from 20hh to 14 inches (35.5cm) They are very cute, I like horses.
