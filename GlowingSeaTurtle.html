<p>   Glowing Hawkesbill Sea Turtles are very rare, they are one of the most protected and endangered species in the world. That makes it very hard for them to be studieed by scientists. Quite a few have been spotted in the pasific islands, it has drawn many scientists to come and try to find them to study them in their natural habitat. </p>
