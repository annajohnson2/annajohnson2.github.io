     <div>    <h1> Glowing Sea Turtle </h1>
<p>   Glowing Hawkesbill Sea Turtles are very rare, they are one of the most protected and endangered species in the world. That makes it very hard for them to be studieed. Quite a few have been spotted in the pasific islands, it has drawn many marine biologists to come and try to find them to study them in their natural habitat. A marine biologist captured a turtle sighting on a video camera system, whose only artificial illumination was a blue light that matched the blue light of the surrounding ocean. A yellow filter on the camera allowed the scientists to pick up fluorescing organisms on the turtle. He followed the turtle for a short while, but after a few minuites he let it go because he didn't want to harass it. The hawksbill proceeded to dive down into the pitch-black ocean.</p>
